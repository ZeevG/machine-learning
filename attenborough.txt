Looking down from two miles above the surface of the Earth it's impossible not to be impressed by the sheer grandeur and splendour and power of the natural world. Ten years ago, in a television series called Planet Earth, we revealed many of those wonders, but today, much has changed. We can now show life on our planet in entirely new ways. Bring you closer to animals than ever before. And reveal new wildlife dramas for the very first time. But that's not all. Our planet has changed too. Never have those wildernesses been as fragile and as precious as they are today. At this crucial time for the natural world, we will journey to every corner of the globe to explore the greatest treasures of our living planet and reveal the extreme lengths animals go to to survive. Finally, we will explore our cities to see how life is adapting to the newest habitat on Earth. This is Planet Earth II. There are hundreds of thousands of islands, each one a world in miniature, a microcosm of our living planet. The struggles to survive on these remote lands reflect the challenges faced by all life on Earth. The tiny island of Escudo off the coast of Panama. Home to the pygmy three-toed sloth. This is a male and life here suits him well. Mangroves provide all the leaves he can eat and there are no predators to worry him. Island life may seem idyllic but it comes at a price. There are only a few hundred pygmy sloths in existence. And he needs a mate. (SCREECHING) That's an enticing call from a female. Somewhere out there. And this, for a sloth, is a quick reaction. (FEMALE SCREECHES AGAIN) The problem is, there's deep water between them. So what should any red-blooded sloth do? Swim, of course. Could this be her? He does his best to put on a turn of speed. But she's not the one. She already has a baby and she won't mate again until it leaves her in about six months' time. Even life on a paradise island can have its limitations. (MORE SCREECHING) But at least she can't be far away. The world's entire population of pygmy sloths is isolated on a speck of land no bigger than New York's Central Park. The size of an island has a huge influence on the fate of those cast away there. The island of Komodo in Indonesia. Home to dragons. Ten feet long and weighing an impressive 150 lbs, these are the largest living lizards on the planet. It's unusual to find large predators on islands. Yet, for four million years, the Komodo dragon has dominated here. It might seem there wouldn't be enough food to support such giants on this relatively small island. But reptiles, being cold-blooded, need only about a tenth of the food a carnivorous mammal would. A single meal will last a dragon a month. There are so successful that their only serious competition comes from others of their own kind. And there are some 2,000 of them here. This giant, however, isn't looking for food... he's looking for a mate. Female dragons come into season only once a year. She's receptive. So far, so good. But he's strayed into someone else's patch. Another huge male thinks he is the king here. Space being limited on islands, dragon territories overlap and that creates continual conflict. In dragon society, size is everything. But if rivals are closely matched, the outcome can be uncertain. Muscular tails strike with the power of sledgehammers. And their serrated teeth are as sharp as steak knives. Each tries to topple his opponent. Defeated. Only the most powerful dragons win the right to mate. The limited food and space on small islands can often lead to intense competition. But some islands are immense. More like miniature continents. And these provide opportunities for life to experiment and evolve. Madagascar is one of the biggest islands and also one of the oldest, having split away from Africa over 120 million years ago. With time and isolation, its animals have adapted to take advantage of every available niche. The island now has some most found nowhere else on Earth. These are not monkeys, but lemurs. From a single ancestor, about The largest, the indri, seldom comes down from the branches. The much smaller ringtails wander in troops across the forest floor searching for food. And tiny bamboo lemurs eat nothing except bamboo. With few competitors, lemurs have been free to colonise almost every environment on the island. Even the most extreme. This baby sifaka has a hard life ahead of it. He's been born in the most arid and hostile corner of Madagascar's vast landscape. If he is to survive here, he has much to learn. The spiny forest is like a desert. It rarely rains, so water and food is very hard to find. Moving from tree to tree is a perilous business. Here, nearly all the plants are covered with ferocious spines. His mother searches the tree tops for the youngest leaves. They provide the only food and water to sustain the family. At three months old, the youngster is starting to explore. All too soon he will have to fend for himself up here. But it's altogether easier to stay on mother's back. If he can master the strange ways of this forest he will have a little corner of Madagascar to himself. Island life encourages animals to do things differently. And on some islands that is essential. There are islands still forming today built by volcanoes. Some erupt explosively. Others pour out rivers of molten rock. Lava. In the last 50 years, ten new volcanic islands have been formed. Newly created and often remote, they're hard for colonists to reach. Even those that do find these are tough places to survive. This is Fernandina, one of the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific. Young and still volcanically active, it's a desolate place. The surrounding sea, however, is particularly rich with life. And the frontier between these two very different worlds is the home of one of the strangest of reptiles. Seagoing iguanas. They are vegetarians, but since there's little food for them on the land, marine iguanas graze on the sea floor. A big male like this one can dive to 30 metres and hold his breath for half an hour. There are more than 7,000 individuals on Fernandina alone. And by bringing nutrients from the sea to the land, the iguanas help other animals to survive here, too. Crabs feed on dead skin on the iguana's back and, in turn, provide a welcome exfoliation service. While smaller lizards prey on the flies that pester the colony. But not all the relationships on this island are so harmonious. Marine iguanas lay their eggs in sand. In June, when the hatchlings emerge, they are vulnerable. They must join the adults at the edge of the sea. But the journey will be a dangerous one. Racer snakes. The snakes miss their chance. But more babies are hatching. And now the snakes are on the alert. This is the best feeding opportunity they will get all year. On flat ground, a baby iguana can outrun a racer snake. But others are waiting in ambush. Another hatchling has its first glimpse of a dangerous world. A snake's eyes aren't very good, but they can detect movement. So if the hatchling keeps its nerve, it may just avoid detection. A near miraculous escape. The lucky survivors can begin learning the unique way of life demanded by this hostile island. Although marine iguanas are expert swimmers, they can't cross open oceans. But even the stormiest waters are no barrier for birds. Gale force winds and cold temperatures make the sub-Antarctic islands off New Zealand particularly unwelcoming in winter. But, when the brief summer comes, temperatures rise and winds slacken. It's now that visitors arrive. All here to breed before winter returns. There's the Snares penguins. Shearwaters come, too. This is an excellent place for them to dig their nesting burrows, for no predators have managed to get here. Soon the island is crowded with birds. Every one of them eager to make the most of the short breeding season. But not everyone has a partner. A male Buller's albatross waits for his mate. Each year they spend six months apart, travelling the ocean. They reunite here to breed. But this year, she's late. No, that's not her. The other birds come and go. The clock is ticking. If she doesn't appear soon, it could be too late for them to breed successfully. Every morning the shearwaters fly off to collect food for their young. Everybody else seems to be getting on with it. The shearwaters' return marks another lost day. There are three million birds on the island, but only one matters to him. Could this be her? At last. At first, he's a little coy. But not for long. They greet each other with the special dance they've perfected over many years. There is much to do if they're to raise a chick before winter returns. But when you have been apart for six months, some things can't be rushed. Islands in warm tropical waters don't experience seasonal extremes. The Seychelles, lying off the coast of East Africa, provide a sanctuary for sea birds all the year round. Fairy terns are permanent residents. They take a fairly relaxed view about what constitutes a nest. A bare branch is quite enough. Climbing onto it to incubate has to be done with care. Once a year, the noddies arrive. They do make nests, and pisonia trees provide their young with a rather less precarious start in life. Nesting on this island looks idyllic. But behind the beauty, there's a sinister side. The Seychelles fody makes quick work of an unattended egg. She knows something's not quite right, but her drive to incubate is strong. The noddies too have a problem. As their chicks grow, so the pisonia trees develop seeds that are sticky and equipped with hooks. By the time the young noddies leave, they carry these hitchhiking seeds away to other islands. But sometimes the pisonia trees are too successful. If a fledgling, testing out its wings, drops to the ground, it can get covered with the seeds. Entangled and weighed down, if it can't free itself, the youngster will starve. The pisonia may have failed to disperse these seeds but it will soon have fertiliser for its roots. This is why some people call the pisonia the "bird catcher tree". The fairy tern laid another egg, and now she has a tiny chick to feed. This chick is lucky. By the time it fledges, the pisonia seeds will have dispersed, and the danger they brought will be gone. Even the most idyllic-looking of islands presents challenges for the animals living there. But the greatest threat they face is change. Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. For millions of years, this remote speck of land has been ruled by crabs. Their ancestors came from the sea, but most have now adopted a land-based existence. Given there are so many of them, they get on relatively harmoniously. They're the gardeners and caretakers of a tiny crab utopia. Once a year, they must all return to the sea to breed, and the march of the red crabs is one of the greatest natural spectacles on earth. There are 50 million of them. It's an event that has brought the island worldwide fame. But in recent years, millions of red crabs haven't managed to reach the sea. An invader has occupied this island. Yellow crazy ants. They escaped from visiting ships and with no predators to control them, they have now created vast super colonies in the forest. When migrating red crabs march into their territory, the ants attack. Squirting acid into the crabs' eyes and mouths. The crabs have no defence. Blinded and confused they're doomed. Humans brought these ant invaders here, and now humans are having to control them. Isolated communities may evolve from millions of years in relative peace. But, when new challenges arrive, they can struggle to cope. Of all the species that have become extinct in recent years, around 80% have been islanders. Our impact on the Earth is greater today than ever before. Yet some islands are so remote that few humans have even set foot on them. Zavodovski Island is one. It lies in the great Southern Ocean. It's not only surrounded by the stormiest of seas, it is itself an active volcano. It's the last place on Earth you would choose to live. Unless you're a chinstrap penguin. There is plenty of food in these waters, but to exploit it, the penguins have to risk their lives. Life here is dangerous in the extreme. (PENGUINS CHATTER) But there are some benefits from living on a volcano. Its warmth melts the snow early in the year. And, by January, the Antarctic's mid-summer, the island is covered in chicks. Parents take turns at guarding them until they're large enough to be left alone. This mother's chicks are hungry, but she has no food left to give them. Their survival depends on their father returning with the next meal. But some don't make it. Skuas harass the colony, hoping to snatch a chick. She can't risk leaving them. Everything will be fine, as long as their father comes back soon. He's been fishing 50 miles offshore, but now he's not far away. For him, however, and for all the other parents here, the worst of the journey is still to come. Tiny claws help him to get whatever grip he can on the rough lava. For these commuters, it's rush hour. Some have had a really bad day. The father now has a two-mile walk to the nest, and a stomach loaded with food doesn't help. This is the largest penguin colony in the world. But as he makes the same journey every other day, he should be able to do it with his eyes closed. It's true that there can be safety in numbers, but numbers can also be something of a problem when you're trying to find your own nest. The mother is still waiting. Her chicks are now desperate. (THEY CHEEP) In the midst of all this deafening chorus, he can recognise her particular cry. At last. Both chicks will get a meal. With a head bob of acknowledgement, their mother now leaves. It's her turn to do the feeding run. This formidable commute is the price these penguins pay for sanctuary. A strange vision of paradise to us, perhaps, but, for one and a half million penguins, this island has it all. Islands may seem remote and insignificant, but they are home to some of the most precious wildlife on Earth. The expedition to film on the island of Zavodovski was the most intrepid shoot of the series. To ensure its success, the team have called in Antarctic expert Jerome Poncet, one of the few people to have set foot on the island. This whole region of Antarctica is rarely visited. And this is the planet's roughest ocean. After seven long days and nights at sea, they get their first glimpse of the final destination. It's actually quite surreal after a whole year, trying to put the expedition together. And then today we wake up, and there's the volcano. That's Zavodovski. The explorers who discovered this place spoke of the stench of sulphurous gases, treacherous waters, and astonishing numbers of penguins. It seems not much has changed. Jerome's been round the whole place, and there literally is only one safe area to get on, and he's telling us it's that rock face over there. The team must take everything they need to survive. There are the penguins! Though the boat'll stay nearby, they will need to be self-sufficient. But that means taking a tonne of equipment up this cliff. Just get to that lot to help. Many flippers make light work. They work all day getting the gear ashore. But the fact there are so many penguins on the island doesn't make it easy. The hardest thing for us has been finding a pathway through, because there's absolutely penguins everywhere you look. Finally, it's time to make camp. They choose a sheltered place that won't disturb the locals. But since most of the penguins won't have seen a human being before, they seem keen to pop over and visit. Hello. Nosy neighbours. The team set off to start documenting the daily lives of the penguins, and what they find is astonishing. As soon as you walk over that ridge, you sort of get a tingly feeling, because I've never seen that many animals in one spot. It's mind-blowing. It's like Glastonbury Festival. The whole landscape is full of little black and white penguins waddling around. This is penguin paradise, and that's what we're trying to show. A promising start. But here, fortunes can change quickly. Every season within ten minutes. As the snow melts, it creates an unforeseen problem. We purposely chose this campsite because it was a place where the penguins didn't seem to go. I think we've realised why the penguins don't nest here. It's because of the spray and because of some run-off, so we are literally in a bit of a bog. And it's not just mud. A couple of these guys, as they wander down to do a spot of fishing, they tend to use my tent as a little poop spot. You kind of get used to it at night, just hearing a constant splat on top of the tent. But, as you can see, all of the kit, I'm afraid that's getting splat on as well. And, when the wind changes, it brings a noxious reminder that they're camping on an active volcano. It's the first time we've smelt sulphur, which is welcome relief from smelling penguins. It's smoking away. I think if they start running for the sea, we're going to be calling Jerome pretty quick for the boat. Each day filming on Zavodovski seems to present a new challenge. Next, a huge storm hits the island. Only now do the team realise just how tough life can be for the penguins. After witnessing the struggles, the penguins must endure, the team now face the same problem. Getting off the island. With another storm coming in, they decide to take their chance. Jerome has seconds to get in and out between the waves. Or the Zodiac could tip leaving them all stranded. Hurray, that's the first box off the island. What took a day to get ashore must be off in minutes. And the swell is getting bigger. Their window of opportunity is closing. Look at this swell now, watch out, watch out! The equipment's off, but now the team has to follow. Luckily it didn't come to that. Safely aboard, they leave with an unforgettable experience of how hard life is on an island at the edge of the world. Next time, we ascend into the planet's highest peaks to discover a spectacular but hostile world, where only the toughest animals can endure. This is life on the roof of the world. Mountains. There are only a dozen peaks in the world that rise five miles high. All of them are here, in the Himalayas. Lethally cold, scoured by gales and blizzards, these mountains are among the most hostile places on Earth. Yet, a few special animals manage to live here. Snow leopards. Like all creatures of the high mountains, they have had to adapt both their body and their behaviour in order to survive. Life at extreme altitude has shaped some of the toughest animals on the planet. (LEOPARD ROARS) The sunbaked mountains of the Arabian Peninsula. They may only be a fraction of the height of the Himalayas, but they are still so dizzyingly steep that in many places it's almost impossible to get a foothold. Yet Nubian ibex have made this their home. (BIRD CALLS) The ibex choose the steepest cliffs to raise their young, in safety, beyond the reach of predators. But living in this sanctuary comes with a cost. These nursery slopes are so steep, there is almost no standing water up here. So to drink, an ibex family must descend into the valley 1,000 feet below. The mothers pick out the safest way down. With soft cloven hooves that grip better than any climbing shoe, they are the most accomplished mountaineers. But the newborn kids are still having to find their feet. This is their first descent. One mistake could make it their last. Following the adults, the kids finally reach the valley. But once on level ground, they're vulnerable. Red foxes lie in wait. At the first sign of danger, the young ibex instinctively run back to steeper ground. (KID BLEATS) But heading for this particular rocky outcrop could be a mistake. It's a 30-foot drop. The fox has them trapped... or so it seems. This is what ibex were born to do. Scattering makes it hard for the fox to pick a target. And it certainly can't follow them up here. All it can do is wait for one to slip and fall. But these youngsters are fast learners, and they're now almost as sure-footed as their parents. The fox will have to find its meal elsewhere. It's just not been a good day. Now, at last, the young ibex can drink. But they'll soon need to return to the safety of the sheer cliffs. Mastering precipitous terrain is always challenging, but there are more fundamental problems for life in the mountains. The Alps. Europe's highest peaks. It's winter, and food is desperately short. A golden eagle has to spend every daylight hour scanning the slopes for something, somewhere, to eat. Her seven-foot wingspan allows her to glide effortlessly for 100 miles in a single day. Her extraordinary eyes enable her to spot prey from two miles away. But she is not the only one who's looking for food. When she spots a chance, she must move fast. She can dive at 200 miles an hour. Only a peregrine is faster. During winter, even eagles rely almost entirely on carrion. It's a dead fox, and it could sustain her for days. Other scavengers must defer. The hungry crows soon regain their courage. They'll try any trick to steal a morsel. And they are annoyingly persistent. But this mob are the least of her worries. A bigger eagle takes control. But this kill is too important to give up. So she must fight. For the moment, she's won the carcass back. But a kill like this will attract every eagle for miles around. As ever, the strongest wins the lion's share. Unable to defend the carcass any longer, the first eagle must now continue its search. It may be many days before she feeds again. Only the most competitive will survive the perils of the mountain winter. (RUMBLING) An avalanche. 100,000 tonnes of snow travelling at 80 miles an hour, capable of smashing everything in its path. The mountains of North America are hit by thousands of avalanches every year. Yet one animal spends the whole winter slumbering within the snow on these avalanche-prone slopes. And when spring comes, they emerge. All across these mountains, grizzly bears make their winter dens 10,000 feet up in the deep snow of leeward slopes. And while they were half-asleep in the depths of winter, their young were born. Now these cubs are taking their first steps into the outside world. This mother is leading her three youngsters to a place where they can find food. (RUMBLING) They need to descend as quickly as possible. The debris from an avalanche is clear evidence that this slope is still dangerously unstable. This is not a place to dawdle. And they have another reason to keep moving. After five months in the den, these bears are very hungry. Bears that have hibernated throughout these peaks now all descend to the valleys, where spring comes earliest. In the Rockies, seasonal change is swift and dramatic. In just a few days, the slopes turn from white to green. Meadows that only a few weeks ago were buried beneath the snow are now full of life. But in these mountains, the good times will not last long. So the bears must feed as fast as they can. During the summer months, an adult can put on 180 kilos gorging on plants and, if they can catch them... - (MARMOT CALLS) - ...a marmot or two. But just now, the bears have something else on their minds. It's becoming warmer, and the bears are keen to shed their thick winter coats. Mothers show the cubs what to do about this. They'll soon catch on. Some trees, it seems, are particularly suitable for rubbing. Bears have their favourites and will travel long distances to visit them. Some itches just have to be scratched. There are now around 30 bears in this one valley. As they rub, each leaves an individual and recognisable scent. So the tree soon carries a list of who's around, which might help individuals to avoid a fight. To best spread their scent, they really have to put their back into it. (BEAR GRUNTS) But summer is short. Itches satisfactorily scratched, it's time to eat. In a couple of months, they will have to return to their dens to hibernate, so now they must put on as much weight as they can. Winter in the mountains returns fast and hits hard. (WIND HOWLS) Temperatures in the Rockies will drop to -54 degrees, so cold that moisture in the air freezes into tiny crystals called diamond dust. This bobcat is one of the few hunters to remain active in winter. Most of his prey is now hidden beneath the snow that covers his entire territory. He hunts by listening for the faintest sound of movement. And to prevent crunching footsteps from revealing his presence, he uses boulders as stepping stones. A mouse. But one is not enough. The deeper the snow, the harder it is to detect prey, and the rewards for the effort can be disappointing. To say the least. By midwinter, the snow is so deep that bobcats are forced to leave their territories to try and find easier hunting. And this bobcat may be in luck. For this particular valley is blessed. A river here never freezes. It's fed by a volcanic hot spring that heats these waters to 50 degrees warmer than the surrounding air. Hungry animals of all kinds come here to feed. Throughout the winter, the river is full of food for those who know how to catch it. Here, even the coyotes have become fishermen. But hunting is hard for a cat that's not used to getting its feet wet. So he must choose his target with care. Goldeneye ducks. But can he get close enough to pounce? (QUACKING) Perhaps he'll have more luck on the other side. Here, steam from the river warms the surrounding trees, so up in the branches, there could be prey. (CHIRPING) If only he could get to it. It's 20 feet up. At last... a squirrel. Not much, but enough to keep him going. To survive a winter in these mountains takes tenacity, and bobcats have that in abundance. Snow on the equator. Unlike the Rockies, in these mountains there are no marked seasons. This is Africa's Mount Kenya. It's 17,000 feet high, which makes its summit some 30 degrees colder than the surrounding savanna. Giant heathers, lobelias and groundsel grow on its upper slopes. They all thrive in the tropical sun. After all, every day is summer. But once the sun sets, every night becomes as bitterly cold as winter. The temperature drops to five degrees below freezing, turning the mountainside into a garden of ice. (CRACKLING) Everything freezes, but the cabbage groundsels have a way of protecting themselves. They close up their leathery leaves to form an insulating blanket that shields their vulnerable central bud. Night comes to an end and the sunshine returns. The groundsels spread their leaves wide to bask in the sunshine once again. Dawn in the High Andes. Here too, the rising sun brings rapid relief to animals living amongst these volcanic peaks. Mountain viscacha are up early to claim the best places to catch the sun's first rays. For others up here, the sunrise is even more welcome. At over 14,000 feet, this is the highest flamingo colony in the world. At night, it gets so cold that even this salty water freezes over. And now the flamingos are trapped in the ice. (FLAMINGOS CALL) Eventually, the sun thins the ice, but it's still a struggle for the flamingos to break free. Walking on thin ice is always risky. And it's hard to retain one's dignity especially when you're wearing stilts. At these altitudes, the sun's power can quickly turn from salvation to threat. The atmosphere is so thin, there is very little protection from ultraviolet radiation. By mid-morning, it's risky to linger out in the open. The viscacha are forced to head for the shade. Out on the lake, there is nowhere to hide. The white crust of the soda lake reflects the sun's glare and increases the impact of its ultraviolet rays. By midday, uncovered human skin will burn in four minutes. But this doesn't seem to bother the flamingos. In fact, they are on parade. During the breeding season, the flamingos perform these peculiar courtship dances even through the hottest time of the day. They are so eager, they don't even pause to feed. The rules are something of a mystery but, after a month of dancing, all the birds will have paired off and will be getting ready to mate. Up here, there are few other creatures to bother the flamingos, but then, few other creatures could even tolerate these conditions. So for animals that have the endurance, mountains can be sanctuaries. But rocky peaks which to us, perhaps, seem a symbol of permanence, are more fragile than they appear. Today in the Alps, human encroachment is changing even the highest summits. In the Rockies, rising temperatures are shortening winter hibernation and stifling the growth of valuable food plants. And in the Andes, some glaciers have shrunk by 50% in just 30 years. Even the Himalayas are now vulnerable. With most of the world's tallest peaks and covering a third of a million square miles, this is the greatest mountain range of all. And here, temperatures are now rising faster than the global average. As the snow line retreats further and further up these peaks, there is less and less space for wildlife, and that is a challenge for one of the most majestic of all mountain creatures. The snow leopard. Seldom seen, the detail of their lives has long been a mystery, but now, at last, helped by the latest remote-camera technology, we are getting closer to them than ever before. They are very rare... only about four of them in 40 square miles. There is simply not enough prey to sustain more. They live solitary lives. Nonetheless, they are well aware of the presence and the movements of their neighbours, because they leave messages in a few special places. They rub particular rocks with their cheeks and then spray them with urine. The two perfumes create a unique signature. (SQUIRTING) Any other leopard can know which of its neighbours passed this way, without ever making direct contact. But there are times when snow leopards must come together, and the event is often violent. An adult female and her daughter. She has devoted the last two years to raising her cub and very soon, it will be weaned. For now, the cub is still entirely dependent on its mother. But staying together as long as this could cause problems. The female is now in heat again, and any male that smells her signature will know that. (SQUIRTING) From this moment on, her cub's life is at risk. Males kill cubs that are not their own. But the mother is now driven by an urge that she cannot control. She lets the males know exactly where she is. (LEOPARD CALLS) From up here, she can be heard for miles around. (LEOPARD CALLS) A young male emerges from the wilderness, eager to find her. Snow leopards meet so infrequently that there is uncertainty and tension. And it's about to get worse. Another, bigger male has arrived. The mother and cub are trapped between the rivals. (GROWLING) The cub is now in danger. Mother must act fast. To divert the males' attention from her cub, she rolls over submissively. With the males fixed on the female, the cub has a chance to escape. (GROWLING) The males close in on the mother from both sides, keen to claim her for their own. A fight is inevitable. The female moves to escape and protect her cub. But the big male follows her. He will not let her leave until he has mated with her. With the males gone, the female is at last reunited with her cub. But she has been injured. The cub, however, is alive, thanks to its mother. Until her injury heals, she won't be able to hunt. Mountain animals survive on the very edge of existence. Mother and cub were not seen again. Until over a month later, high on a ridge, a remote camera was triggered. The female cat. She's no longer limping, but she's now alone. Then, an hour after the female has left, the camera is triggered again. It's her cub, taking her first steps towards adulthood and independence. She is unlikely to see her mother again. But every now and then, they will be reunited through the messages they leave on the marking rocks. Her mother has succeeded in raising her, but life ahead will be challenging, and she will spend nearly all of it alone. Only the toughest can survive among the savage beauty of the world's highest mountains. Revealing a new perspective on the lives of golden eagles in the mountains would take two very different approaches. A traditional wildlife crew set out to film wild eagles closer than ever before. Whilst an aerial team aimed to capture the hunting flights of eagles high in the mountains. The helicopter crew soon have success in filming wild eagles high over the Alps, but there was one part of the story even they couldn't follow. Golden eagles can stoop at 200 miles an hour. To capture an eagle's-eye view of such a dramatic flight would take a more extreme approach. I'm Aaron Durogati and I'm a professional paraglider pilot. Aaron believes that to fly like a bird, he must think like one, too. It's a very special feeling to fly with eagles because I'm really looking how they are thermalling and where they go to soar. This helps me to become a better pilot, and I try to take inspiration from the nature. Wearing a specially designed helmet camera, Aaron's aim is to film the perspective of a diving eagle. But before he can jump off a mountain, first he needs to climb it. It's a tough 3,000m ascent for Aaron and his wingman, Armin, as director Emma Brennand waits for news in the valley below. The ascent is slowed by a series of dangerous crevasses. After a tricky climb, they finally reach their launch site. But the weather up here is unpredictable and a change in wind direction makes it impossible to take off. Aaron and Armin are forced to overnight in the summit shelter, and with the cold knocking out their comms, Emma is worrying. They're well-trained mountain guides, but it doesn't make it any easier to know that. I think it's going to be a fairly restless night for me as well. Whilst the paragliders prepare for a night on the mountain cameraman Barrie Britton is setting out early on a more cautious quest to film wild golden eagles from a hide. I've got to get everything set while it's still dark and the eagles can't see what we're up to. Or if they saw any movement around the hide, then they'd fly away and probably wouldn't come back for a few days. They're notoriously difficult birds to film. Even hide work is not entirely without risks. It's -20 outside. So this is a crucial part of the operation, making sure the fire works so we don't freeze to death. Aah! Well, that's all the hairs gone on my hand! Oh, well! And we just have to be really quiet now and hope the eagles come in when first light comes up. Eight sedentary hours later, Barry's only reward is a dead leg. We haven't done a single shot today. Nothing has come. Anyway, that's the way it goes. After a long night on top of the mountain, the weather is only getting worse. The team need to get down, but visibility's so poor that descending on foot past the crevasses is too risky. Aaron decides it's safer to fly, but it'll be a bumpy ride. Thick cloud makes it hard to avoid the mountains, let alone film them. Thankfully, they make it down in one piece, much to Emma's relief. We are very, very glad to see you both. Yeah, it's a bit hard up there. The team spend the next two weeks chasing weather windows until at last, a clear flight. Trying to mimic a diving eagle, the flying looks spectacular, but the helmet-cam shots are less so. To stay safe at these speeds, Aaron must turn his head regularly to check his glider, and that is making the shots unusable. The team must quickly come up with a new plan. Back in the hide, all has been quiet until Barrie spots an eagle scavenging on a fox carcass. Barrie repositions his hide to keep watch. Good stuff! After 100 hours in the hide, finally, his luck changes. That's one terrifying bird there. For me, it's fantastic just to see them so close. It's just beautiful. With Barrie's success, it's now down to the paragliding team. They've come to the Mont Blanc range with a new plan. Aaron's decided that the best way to keep safe and get stable shots is to fly tandem with a cameraman. We've got to try and mimic how an eagle flies, which is pretty hard because they're basically like the top bird of prey. John is nervous. It's his first-ever flight. Three, two, one, go. Eee... ahh! Yes! Woohoo! - How is it? - Ah, man, that was a shock. Overcoming his initial fears, John begins filming. If you can go right of this, that'd be cool. The tandem wing allows John to get the shots that Aaron was unable to get flying solo. Awesome, Aaron, very good. But it's not all plain sailing. The feeling of discomfort only gets worse as Aaron begins the eagle dive. (JOHN LAUGHS) I feel sick! Oh, man! Flying low and fast like an eagle leaves little room for error. - A little bit too much, do you think? - Yeah! - Sorry, what did you call it, an unplanned landing? - Yeah! They might not be as majestic as a golden eagle, but they do capture a unique perspective that conveys an eagle's life as never before. Next time... we explore the world's jungles. Places of surprise and invention unrivalled on Earth where the battle for survival is at its most intense. Earth is the only planet we know of where life exists. And, here, it does so in abundance. The jungle is Eden. It covers less than 6% of the Earth's surface but it's home to half of all the plants and animals on land. Jungles have just the right amount of light, water and nutrients, and they have had every day for millennia. Life here should be easy. This is an indri. It's a primate, like us. And these forests in Madagascar are its home. But to survive here it has to face one major challenge. Paradise is crowded. Life fills every niche. And, at any one time, a staggering variety of species and countless individuals are striving for space and food. Like every jungle animal, indri have to find their own way to survive in the most competitive place on Earth. (INDRI WAILS) (INDRI WAILS) Jungles are complex places tangled three-dimensional worlds created by lush tropical vegetation. 90% of the animals here spend their whole lives up in the trees. And each of them has to find its own way of getting around. Hanging 100 feet above the ground, a spider monkey. They travel in family groups and find everything they need in the top storey of the jungle. Up here isn't a place for the faint-hearted. With long limbs and a prehensile tail that can grip like a hand, they're built for climbing. But imagine having to learn these skills as high up as this. One third of spider monkeys never make it to adulthood. This youngster is only a few months old. Her future depends on her ability to climb. Playing on a practice tree with her older brother and sister, she's already learning to use her tail as a safety line under her father's close watch. (THEY CHATTER) She's keen to join in the game but she's the youngest and, as is the way of things, she's not always welcome. (SHE GIBBERS) So she chooses her own place to play. But not all trees are the same. This one is for more advanced climbers. Enthusiasm? Certainly! (SHE GIBBERS) Technique? (SHE CHATTERS) Room for improvement. Meanwhile, some of her family have moved on to look for a new patch of fresh food. The top of the canopy isn't for youngsters. But Father's not looking and the temptation to join the others is irresistible. She'll need to be careful. A fall from here would mean certain death. It's the first time she's been as high as this on her own. As she climbs still higher, the branches get thinner and thinner. (SHE SCREECHES) (SHE SCREECHES) Her tail has caught her but now she's stuck in mid-air, unable to reach any other branch. (SHE SCREECHES) Father, however, was watching. He's big and strong enough to form a bridge with his body so that she can climb to safety. Lesson learned. But it's not just monkeys that live here, up in the treetops. And, if you are small, finding the right tree can mean a home for life. He's a Draco lizard. He's only the size of a pencil and he eats ants. This one tree could provide him with all he will ever need... a conveyor belt of food. It's a perfect place to settle down. Well, it would be but there's already someone here. This larger male is the tree's owner. And Dracos don't share. The owner's flag is a warning. Trespassers won't be tolerated. The owner's not only intimidating he's prepared to battle. A dead end. Safety is a long way away. Now he must choose. Fight or flee? Only in the jungle do you find lizards that can soar like dragons. He can travel over 100 feet in a single leap. It's a very fast and efficient way to move through the jungle. Maybe this new tree will have food and no resident owner. Everything in the jungle has to compete for space. Only 2% of the sun's rays reach the ground so even the plants must battle for the light they need if they're to grow. 300 years ago, this Hura tree began its race for light. And every day since, it has absorbed the water and sunshine it needed to grow into a giant. It has succeeded in doing what every tree must do to survive rise above the gloom of the jungle floor. And, what is more, its success has given life to others. Its branches now carry 1,000 other plants. These particular ferns, figs and orchids live only on the branches of other trees. 1,000 plants growing on one single tree. Throughout the forest, this story is repeated endless times. As a consequence, jungles are home to more species of plants than anywhere else on Earth. And they, in turn, support a wealth of animals. In Ecuador, the competition is at its most intense. Here, there are 100 species of hummingbirds alone all fighting for nectar. Each flower only has a small amount at any one time, and so it's first come, first served. One hummingbird has gone to great lengths to avoid conflict with other species. Swordbills are the only bird with a beak longer than their body. And some flowers are too elongated for the other 99 species of hummingbirds here to feed from them. A swordbill's extraordinary beak, however, enables it to reach the places that others can't the top of this flower, where the sweet nectar is produced. It has found a solution that means it doesn't have to join the fight. And, as each long flower blooms, it gives the swordbill a fresh supply of food all to itself. But having a beak longer than your body does have its drawbacks. For a start, it's tricky to keep it clean. Harder still, how do you preen your body feathers? Unlike the other hummers, swordbills can't reach their feathers with their beak. The only option, a good old scratch. It's a little unrefined but a small price to pay for an exclusive food supply especially when feeding times are only too frequently interrupted by storms. (THUNDER RUMBLES) Jungles are the richest places on Earth because of one remarkable fact they make their own weather. Every day, water rises from the surface of the leaves as vapour. It's as if the trees breathe out clouds. They gather over the forest until, finally they burst. Rain is the lifeblood of every jungle. And all have to do their best to endure the daily downpour. In some jungles, like here in Brazil, it rains so much that, for part of the year, the trees are almost totally submerged. The forest floor is 30 feet below the water's surface. This is a mysterious world, a place few people have ever explored. We have much to discover about the animals for which this is home including some you might never expect to find amongst trees. Here, 1,000 miles from the sea, are dolphins. A newly identified species of river dolphin found nowhere else on Earth. (DOLPHIN WHISTLES) In these black, tangled waters, they have become almost totally blind, so they move slowly, carefully using their sonar to scan the forest floor for fish. If this forest can hide a new species of dolphin what else might there be here, awaiting discovery? At the shallow margins of the flooded jungle, rivers flow through lush vegetation. Here, food is so abundant, it supports giants. Capybara, the biggest rodents in the world... (GRUNTING) ...giant otters the size of a man... (THEY SQUEAK) ...and the rulers of these rivers... (SPLASH) ...caiman. They grow to ten feet long and kill anything they get between their jaws. But there are more artful hunters drawn here from the surrounding forest. A jaguar, the supreme jungle predator. The river marks the edge of his territory but here he has competition. (THEY GROWL) (THEY ROAR) (THEY GROWL) He's now in the territory of a female. She has ruled this stretch of river for five years. This is her place to hunt. Capybara are strong and wary. The key is stealth. She needs to get within three feet if she's to pounce. Not this time. She's not the only female here. Each part of this jungle's edge is ruled by a different queen. Few places on Earth have enough food to support so many big cats. (LOW GROWL) The male hunts in a different way. Weighing almost 300 lbs, it's hard to be stealthy and with so many other jaguars around, he doesn't bother with wary capybara. He seeks a different prey. He's become a killer of killers. Jaguars have the most powerful bite of any cat. And he knows the caiman's most vulnerable point the back of its skull. (CRUNCHING) Hunters living in the dense understorey of the jungle come in all shapes and sizes. But they share a problem. How to tell what is a plant, and what is prey. This is a game of hide and seek that can be won or lost in the blink of an eye. The long contest between predator and prey has produced mimicry of astounding accuracy. A leaf-tailed gecko masquerading as lichen. Some animals take camouflage a stage further still and these streams in Costa Rica are home to one of the most remarkable. A glass frog. A male, and tiny, no bigger than your fingernail and almost entirely transparent as he needs to be. Almost everything that walks past here could eat him, even a cricket. His best chance is to stay absolutely still and trust that the cricket looks right through him. Danger passed, and that's just as well, because he is a father and he's guarding some very precious eggs. For the last few weeks, females, one after the other, have visited him and entrusted him with their offspring. Some are now almost ready to hatch. There are several clutches on the leaf, and those at the top, the most recently laid, are barely a day old. But in the jungle, there's always someone out to get you. This wasp is a specialist hunter of frogs' eggs. It's noticed the wriggling tadpoles at the bottom of the leaf. He mustn't move. The youngest eggs are the most vulnerable, and he can't guard them all. But these tadpoles are not as helpless as they might appear. Incredibly, the unhatched tadpoles can sense danger, and the oldest and strongest wriggle free and drop into the stream below. The eggs at the top of the leaf, however, are still too young to hatch, and now the wasps know they're there. But the male's back looks very like the youngest cluster of eggs and that seems to confuse the wasps. Using his own body as a decoy is a huge risk. The wasp stings could kill him. He's managed to save most of his young. He'll have to remain on guard for another two weeks, but in the jungle, just surviving the day can count as a success. With the coming of the night, a new cast of jungle characters takes to the stage. Flying insects begin to glow as they search for mates. Fungi, unlike plants, thrive in the darkness of the forest floor. They're hidden until they begin to develop the incredible structures with which they reproduce. Each releases millions of microscopic spores that drift invisibly away. Many have fruiting bodies that reach upwards to catch any feeble current there might be in the clammy air. But this one, as it grows, becomes luminous. Why fungi light up has remained a mystery until now. Scientists studying the brightest fungi in the world think they may have an answer. Like a beacon, the light attracts insects. From far and wide. To this click beetle, a bright light means only one thing... a female click beetle, so he flashes in reply. But he doesn't get the reception he was expecting. Confused, he starts searching for a female, and that helps the fungus. By the time he gives up, he's covered in the fungus's spores. And, as he continues his quest for a female, he carries these spores to other parts of the forest. And there are even stranger things glowing in the jungle night. These are the multicoloured lights of a railroad worm. It's not really a worm, but a poisonous, caterpillar-like beetle. The yellow lights warn other creatures to keep out of its way. It's hunting for millipedes. When it finds the trail of one, it switches off its yellow lights. Now it only has a red light on its head. Millipedes can't see red light. So, to them, the railroad worm in stealth mode is virtually invisible. And that is the end of the millipede. Competition in the jungles forces animals to specialise in every aspect of their life, including courtship. This has produced some of the most beautiful and elaborate displays on the planet. - (BIRD SQUAWKS) - A male red bird-of-paradise, competing to attract a female by dancing. One has come to survey what's on offer. She is an independent lady, and she will select whichever male takes her fancy. (BIRDS SQUAWKING) She makes her choice. But now she doesn't seem quite so sure. No? Perhaps he's just a little too keen. Maybe he'll have better luck tomorrow. Red birds-of-paradise display in the treetops. Other members of the family dance in the gloom of the forest floor. This is a Wilson's bird-of-paradise. He's brightly coloured, but about the size of a sparrow. He's lived most of his life alone, but now he's an adult, and he too needs to attract a mate. This little patch of light might help him do so. First, he tidies things up. Showing off in this jumble of leaves wouldn't be easy, and his beauty will stand out better against a plain background. He doesn't want bright leaves to divert a visitor's attention. They all need to go. Even the green ones. Especially the green ones. His stage is set. A central pole, and a little patch of light. It's perfect. And now, he must hope a female hears his call. (HIGH-PITCHED SQUAWKING) He can wait here for weeks on end. At last, a female. Time to take up position. She will judge him by the brightness of his feathers. But for the female to see him at his best, he needs her to perch directly above his stage, under the light. This might be his only chance to shine. Now, when she's looking directly down on him, he reveals a display for her eyes only. In the gloom of the forest floor, he is a dazzling blaze of iridescent green. The brightest leaf in the forest. And that does the trick. Each animal must find its own way of surviving the competition of the jungle. This crowded world is so full of invention that almost all kinds of animals on land can trace their origins back here including us. These forests in Madagascar are home to one of our distant cousins. This female indri has fought to keep this particular patch of forest safe for herself and her family. (HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKS) Every morning, the family come together to sing, their way of reminding others that this is their home. Indri are so closely adapted to living here that now they can live nowhere else. For them and the billions of animals with whom they share their home, the jungle is a sanctuary. But this is changing. Even in the ten years since the head of this family was born, one million hectares of the rainforest have been destroyed in Madagascar alone, and, with it, half the indri families that once lived there. The local people say the indris are our brothers and their song is a call to remind us that we, too, once depended on the jungle. This Eden is still a place of wonder and magic. Something, surely, worth protecting. Jungles are still some of the least explored places on Earth, and with good reason. They are testing places to work. Here in the flooded forests of Brazil, the team are on the trail of a newly discovered species of river dolphin. So little is known about it that just finding it will be a challenge. Their base for five weeks is a hut on the only bit of dry land around, but it's already occupied. It appears someone's been making a nest. A resident rat. - Hello, little rat. - And on the food cupboard... Hello. Are you a bit shy? If the housemates are hostile, the hitchhikers are even worse. A large spider. Oh, my God. And a colony of aggressive red ants looking for a ride. Shall we knock into them? They'll board the boat like a bunch of pirates, and they'll gnaw our faces off. That might not be quite true, but intimidating animals are the least of their problems. The flooded forest is not only vast, it's impenetrable, and this new species of dolphin could be anywhere in 150,000 square miles of tangled treetops. But the crew have a plan. Dolphins use sound to find their way through the flooded forest by making clicks. Sonar. Waterproof microphones allow the crew to eavesdrop on the dolphins, and so follow them. But that's easier said than done. So, this is the clear path. Can you see it? There. It takes them a week to get their first glimpse of this new species, and even then, it lasts less than a second. There appears to be only one dolphin. And, frustratingly, it can pop up anywhere without warning. Been looking through the water and seeing bodies kind of appear out of the murk, and then disappear again. Eventually, the dolphin leads the crew to an open gap in the forest. We made it! Yay! Here, at last, there may be a chance of getting something in the can. Their first shot, but again, a single breath, and then it's gone. - Hello, you. - With the dolphin as close as this, the crew can try a different technique... towing an underwater camera behind the boat. Dolphin literally just came up parallel to it. The problem is that the water is so murky, that the dolphin is almost invisible, even when right next to the camera. However, now the dolphin is in this channel, the crew can try a different tack. Michael Sanderson is a drone operator. As long as the dolphin's in open water, it might be possible to follow it from the air. We've worked out the dolphins seem to be here, and we can do the drone work, so this is our kind of best bet. Leaving Michael and his drone on the sand spit, the crew head back to open water. But this is called the flooded forest for a reason. The rain here can be torrential, and although storms normally pass quickly, this one is clearly not a normal storm. Is it not working? The motor has broken, and with the boat flooding, the crew must head for the bank. It looked like the rainstorm was going to pass, and it hasn't passed at all. It's very, very heavy, and I'm soaked through to the skin. They're stranded, the kit is getting drenched, trees are falling, and Michael is trapped somewhere down-river. This is the hardest rain I've ever seen in my life. - It's incredible. - I'm hoping Michael's all right. And there's been tree fall all up around behind us. Michael's down there on a tiny little sand spit, with the other boat, with his opticopter out. Kind of scary. After two hours, a break in the storm gives Michael a chance to rejoin the team. Just got caught in one of the heaviest storms I've ever seen. Got up to this much water on the tarp, and the other one, so I don't know if this is going to live any more, because that was on the floor. It looks like it's game over for the drone. Yeah, it was pretty scary, wasn't it? Over the next 12 hours, the storm returns again and again. If this bad weather continues, the crew may not be able to get back out to the dolphin. The next morning, clear skies, and the drone might be fixable. But the longer it takes, the more chance that the dolphin will have returned to the flooded forest, and then it'll be back to square one. But finally, their luck is in. The dolphin is still there. For the first time, they have a chance to film from the water and the air, and finally discover what this elusive animal is really doing. They were in the boat and they were looking around and going, "Yeah, there are some bubbles." We were flying with the drone and we could see dolphins, and while they thought they could only see one dolphin, we saw five. And they had no idea. The crew are surprised to find these dolphins aren't solitary, but come together to hunt as a team. You're starting to see stuff with the drone that you suddenly go, "I thought there was one dolphin there," and then you count that there are five and then you're looking in one place and they're all behind you, laughing at you. This new perspective has given the crew a first glimpse into a mysterious jungle animal in one of the least-known corners of the Earth. Next time... a land of extremes that pushes life to the limit. Animals have extraordinary ways of dealing with the hostile conditions. Creating the most epic survival stories on Earth. These are deserts. Imagine a world where temperatures rise to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Where there's no escape from sun, wind and dust. Imagine a world with almost no food or water. These are the conditions in one third of the lands of our planet. To live here demands the most extraordinary survival strategies. This is the oldest desert in the world. The Namib in south-west Africa. It's been dry for 55 million years. Life here for a hunter is as hard as it gets. A pride of lions. One of the very few that endures this desert's scorching temperatures and lack of water. Hunting here presents special problems. A herd of oryx, the only prey within 20 miles. Out here, there is no cover for an ambush. It'll have to be a straight chase. They have failed and each failed hunt brings the lions closer to starvation. To find enough to eat, the pride continually searches an area the size of Switzerland. Three days and 100 miles later, and still no kill. These are desperate times. (BIRDS CAW) A dry riverbed on the edge of their territory. The only animals here are giraffe, but these one-tonne giants could kill a lion with a single kick. Lions seldom tackle such formidable prey but this pride can't go on much longer without food. The whole pride must work together as a team if they're to succeed. Two lionesses lead the chase. Others race to cut off possible escape routes. The giraffe has the speed and stamina to outrun the pride but it's being chased into a trap. Up ahead, the lead female waits. It's now up to her. Most lion hunts end in failure. But no lions fail more often than those that live in the desert. Once again, the pride must continue their search. (THUNDER RUMBLES) It does, sometimes, rain in the desert. Here, in the American West, storms can strike with devastating force. After ten months of drought, millions of tonnes of water are dumped on the land in under an hour. Over millions of years, sand and gravel carried by the rampaging floods have carved channels through the solid rock. Slot canyons, 150 feet deep. In some places, these canyons have widened until the land between them is sculpted into tablelands and isolated pinnacles, some of the most dramatic landscapes on the planet. The rain may be long gone but there is water here locked away within the tissues of specialist desert plants. Cacti are unique to American deserts. They all hoard water, storing it in swollen stems and protecting it behind a barricade of spines. They're so successful that they dominate these deserts. But this forest of spikes can cause problems for the animals that live here. A Harrisxxx hawk. It has developed special techniques for hunting amongst the cacti. Ground squirrels. Prey. At the first sign of danger they bolt for the safety of the thorns. But the hawks have a tactic to flush them out. These are the only birds of prey that hunt in packs. Flying in formation, they try to drive their quarry into the open. But this squirrel is staying put. So now the hawks continue the hunt on foot. They're closing in from all sides. Soon, all escape routes are cut off. The squirrel is trapped. The spines that cover almost every plant in this desert can provide protection and shelter for many animals. So, why should these spikes be hung with corpses? What kind of creature could be responsible for creating such a gruesome scene? There's a mysterious killer at work in this desert. It's a butcherbird. This little songbird uses the spines as a butcher uses his hook... to hold its prey as it dismembers it. (CHICKS SQUAWK) And with chicks to feed, he also uses the spines as a larder. He's been stocking it for weeks. Hanging his prey out of the reach of scavengers on the ground ensures that his newly hatched young will never go hungry. An ingenious solution to making the good times last in the desert if a little macabre. (CHICKS SQUAWK) Some deserts are so arid, they appear totally devoid of all vegetation. Yet even these landscapes can be transformed in a matter of days. The deserts of Peru are amongst the driest in the world, but just add a little water and plants that have lain dormant for months will burst into life. And when a desert suddenly turns green, even the most seemingly desolate can become a land of opportunity. No creature exploits the greening of a desert more quickly or more dramatically than a locust. Madagascar's arid south-west has received its highest rainfall in years. Now, an army is on the march, attracted by the smell of newly sprouting grass. Locusts are normally solitary creatures, but when food becomes suddenly plentiful they come together into an unstoppable force that devours everything in its path. But this devastation is about to get a lot worse. The locusts now transform into winged adults, and with conditions as good as this, they do so three times faster than normal. Now they are at their most voracious... and with wings, they can take to the skies. Once airborne, the locusts can travel over 60 miles a day in their search for new feeding grounds. A super swarm of this scale may only appear once in a decade. This one extends over 200 square miles and contains several billion individuals. Between them, they will devour Nothing can strip a land of its vegetation with such speed and thoroughness as a plague of locusts. When the food eventually runs out, the whole army will die... but not before it's devastated the land. With no plants to bind them, thin soils soon turn to dust and blow away. Now, these barren lands are left to the mercy of the elements. Scorched by the sun and scoured by windblown sand, desert rock is shaped into strange, otherworldly landscapes. These rocky deserts may have a beguiling beauty, but when they become this barren, very little life can endure. For many animals, the only way to survive the most hostile times is to keep moving. In the Kalahari, brief rains have given way to the dry season. Food and water are becoming increasingly scarce. For these zebra, it's time to leave. They're setting off on the longest overland migration made by any mammal in Africa, marching towards the scent of distant rains. As drought intensifies, desert-living elephants must also undertake long journeys in search of water. The older females can remember where, even in times of extreme drought, there may still be water and sometimes lead the herd to a water hole they may not have visited for decades. These zebra are almost at the end of their journey. This is what they've been heading for a rare water hole. In deserts, most water holes are short lived. They appear after rains, but then vanish almost as quickly as they came. Animals have come here from many miles around. Yet this can be a dangerous place in which to linger. 60 miles away, in the heart of the desert, sandgrouse chicks are hatching. It's safer for them to be here. But being so distant from water is a gamble. With only their mother to shield them from the sun, if they get nothing to drink, they will be dead within hours. Their only hope is their father. Every morning he makes the 120-mile round trip to get water for the family. Grouse from all over the desert visit this oasis, arriving together in large flocks, and that is important. There's safety in numbers. The male snatches a drink, but he also needs to collect water for his chicks. Using specially adapted breast feathers, he can soak up water like a sponge. But it takes time, and he is in danger. Goshawk. Sandgrouse here are their main prey. Again and again, the male sandgrouse risk their lives in order to collect water for their chicks. This is why sandgrouse nest so far from water holes. At last, he's soaked up as much as he can. Carrying a quarter of his body weight in water, he can now set off on the long journey home. He's back, and just in time. He can give the chicks their first ever drink. But he will have to undertake this perilous journey every day for the next two months until his chicks can finally make the flight to the water hole for themselves. It's July in the deserts of Nevada in the western United States. The hottest time of the year. Bands of wild horses, mustang, are converging on one of the last remaining water holes for miles. Now, water not only offers them the chance to drink, it can also bring power. If a stallion can control access to water, he will have secured mating rights to the entire herd. So stallions try to dominate these pools, fighting off rivals who venture too close. A stranger. He's travelled ten miles to be here because the pools where he's come from have already dried up. With him come his females. If he can't provide them with water, they will leave him for the white stallion who already dominates this pool. So, he will have to fight. There is everything to lose. A broken leg or a shattered jaw would mean a slow and painful death. A missed kick, and it's all over. The new arrival has won... and his prize is more than just the chance to drink. He has provided for his herd, and in the process, stolen his rival's females. The white stallion's rule is over. Desert life is not only shaped by the scarcity of water, but also by the relentless power of the sun. The highest temperatures on Earth have all been recorded in its deserts. Changes in the climate mean temperatures here are rising more than the global average and, as deserts heat up, they are also expanding. Every year, a further 50,000 square miles of grass and farmland are turning into barren stretches of dust and rock. In the heat of the day, surface temperatures can reach 160 degrees, far too hot to handle for most. But not for this shovel-snouted lizard. Raising its feet off the ground in turn enables each to briefly cool. But even this dancing desert specialist can't stand the heat for long. One option is to find shade. Dune grass, the only vegetation here, provides virtually none, but just an inch beneath the surface of the sand, it is several degrees cooler. Avoiding the extreme heat imposes a rhythm on desert life. And many animals here choose the simplest option of all staying hidden all day, and only venturing out in the cool of the night. As darkness falls, animals appear from seemingly nowhere. And, among them, inevitably, are hunters. One of the most voracious nocturnal predators is also one of the hardest to see. This mysterious creature hardly ever appears on the surface of the dunes. But there are signs on the sand that can give it away. It lives only here, where the sand grains are so perfectly dry and polished, that they flow almost like water. It's no bigger than a ping-pong ball. A golden mole. It's totally blind, but there's nothing to see underground anyway. Instead, it has superb hearing. Its entire head acts as an amplifier that picks up vibrations through the sand, so, to locate prey on the surface of the dune, it has, paradoxically, to thrust its face into the dune. Termites. Not easy to catch when you're blind. Far better to go into stealth mode. Once below the sand, it can detect the slightest movement allowing it to strike with pinpoint accuracy. Well, most of the time. They can travel two thirds of a mile a night in search of its dinner and right now, it has just detected its main course. Little wonder it's sometimes called "the shark of the dunes". Food can be so scarce in the desert that, even at night, animals can't afford to be choosy about what they eat. Israel's Negev desert. Otonycteris, the desert long-eared bat, is on the hunt. Most bats catch flying insects on the wing, but there are so few of these in the desert that this bat must do things differently. It has to hunt on the ground. But what really sets it apart is what it's hunting a deathstalker scorpion. The venom of this species is potent enough to kill a human. Tackling it seems madness for a bat weighing just half an ounce. In the pitch-black, both predator and prey are effectively blind, but the scorpion has one advantage... he can sense the approach of the bat through vibrations in the sand. Otonycteris must rely entirely on its hearing. If the scorpion doesn't move, it won't know it's there. The battle is on. Armed with crushing pincers and a sting loaded with venom, this scorpion is a dangerous opponent. A direct strike on the head. Is it all over? Not for this bat. Otonycteris clearly has some immunity to the venom, but repeated stings must still be extraordinarily painful. And if the bat is not to go hungry, it must catch another three scorpions before sunrise. Desert animals have developed remarkable strategies to make the most of the rare opportunities that come their way. Although some deserts may not see rain for several years, most will hold a little water in one form or another. The trick is simply knowing how to reach it. Dawn in the dunes of the Namib, and something magical is happening. Moist air lying over the neighbouring Atlantic is cooled and blown inland, forming fog banks that shroud the desert in mist. This precious moisture lies tantalisingly out of reach at the top of the dunes, and it won't last long. It'll be burnt off by the sun just hours after it rises. Darkling beetles race to the top of the dunes to reach the fog before it vanishes. Some of the Namib's dunes are 1,000 feet high, the tallest in the world. For a beetle no larger than a thumbnail, this is the equivalent of us climbing a dune twice the height of Everest. But even more impressive is what it does next. Standing perfectly still, facing into the wind, the beetle does a headstand. Fog begins to condense on its body. Microscopic bumps on its wing cases direct the water to grooves that channel it towards the mouth. Before returning down the slip face, it will drink 40% of its body weight. This little beetle has learned how to conjure water out of the air in one of the driest places on earth. And it's not alone on the top of the dunes. Web-footed geckos use a similar trick. Surely, few animals go to greater lengths to get a drink. Unfortunately, Namaqua chameleons know that on foggy mornings, the beetles coming down the dunes are juicier than those going up. The diversity of life that thrives in a world almost totally devoid of water is truly remarkable. Success in the desert depends on an extraordinary variety of survival strategies that have evolved over millions of years. But our planet is changing. The world's deserts are growing bigger, hotter and drier, and they're doing so faster than ever before. How life will cope here in the future remains to be seen. Finding animals in these vast empty landscapes was a persistent problem for the Deserts team. But surely this wouldn't be the case when they set out to film one of the greatest concentrations of wildlife on earth. It can't be hard to find a billion locusts, can it? OK. With news that freak rains have triggered a mass emergence of locusts in a remote part of Madagascar, the team sets off in pursuit. We've got some young hopper locusts just crossing the road in front of us here. We've just had to stop the cars. Here they are, here, all on the side of the road, look. It looks promising. But though finding hoppers is easy, filming them proves more of a challenge. Can we rethink this? Because it's not really working. The locusts are really skippy. Any kind of movement, they just freak out, So we're now doing our best locust-herding techniques to try to get them to go in front of the lens, which is proving harder than anticipated. This is my Monday morning locust-herding jazz hands. - Ah! - What? What's that? - What? - It's a wasp nest. Soon, the crew find themselves surrounded by locusts. No need for jazz hands now. It's a good start, but the team still need to film the winged swarms that complete the story. But, once airborne, they can travel 60 miles a day, so finding a swarm won't be easy. Fortunately, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation are here, too, to help. The FAO are on a mission to eradicate the plagues decimating crops across Madagascar, and if anyone knows where the locusts are, it's the local expert, Hasibelo. He thinks that they are moving this way. Time to go swarm-chasing. But chasing is the operative word. The locusts always seem one step ahead. It's amazing, really, because this plan's completely - radically changing, hour by hour. - We now have to travel several hours further north, which is... - a bit of a pain. - It's a bit of a pain. As they venture into the unknown, it's clear it's been a very wet year indeed. Traffic is one thing, but boats on the road? Unconventional traffic. Progress is slow, and soon stops altogether. The locusts are just across the water, so the team must follow on this. What could possibly go wrong? We're now stuck on, possibly, the world's most antiquated raft trying to cross a very fast-flowing river. But, onwards and upwards. We've now got an hour-long river crossing, and we'll just have to see what's on the other side. With the river behind them, it should be plain sailing. But once across, the team discovers that, yet again, the locusts are nowhere to be seen. And, after two weeks on the road, the local street food is beginning to take its toll. So Ed's not very well. Been yacking up and... And not very nice stomach. We just need to do whatever it takes now to get us to where the swarms are. The next day, the team forges on. Briefly. Here's Jamal, our driver. What do we think? Yeah? No? The road has turned into a bog. The cars can go no further. We need to cross this area of water to get to the savanna and find our locust swarms. And it's amazing to think that, with the combined might of the United Nations and the BBC, we are eventually defeated by a puddle. Back to the drawing board. Once again, it's Hasibelo to the rescue. Well, we have a plan. Taking to the air was never on the cards, but thanks to the FAO's helicopter, the team can now play the locusts at their own game. More smoke? This time, it's a billion locusts and one very relieved producer. Woohoo! Against the odds, the team has located a super-swarm. This is exactly what we've been looking for. We've driven halfway across Madagascar to one of the most remote parts there is. It's just been a nightmare, but, finally, we're here. I mean, this is the biggest swarm we could have even hoped for. It is just amazing. Look at here, I'm going to film here. It's incredibly exhilarating, and yet totally shocking, to think of the devastation that swarms like this are causing. It just makes you realise how important the FAO are in getting this under control. I'm just going to run through it. I should be naked for this, but... Thankfully, Rob kept his clothes on, and, more importantly, this plague has now been halted, but not before the team had witnessed one of the biggest swarms ever recorded on film. Next time, we journey to the world's great plains, where spectacular gatherings of wildlife cope with extreme change and surprising creatures survive in unexpected ways. One quarter of all the land on Earth is covered by a single, remarkable type of plant. Almost indestructible, it can grow two feet in a day... And be tall enough to hide a giant. That plant is grass, and the world it creates is truly unique. The grass in northern India is the tallest on the planet, home to some of the most impressive creatures to tread the Earth. These are the good times, but in just a few months, all this fresh growth will be gone, and the animals will be forced to move on. That is the way things are on grasslands across the planet. A cycle of abundance, destruction and rebirth that affects every creature that lives here. The largest grassland on Earth, the vast Eurasian Steppe, stretches one third of the way around our planet. Spring rain has brought fresh grass, and with it, new life. A relic from the Ice Age, a baby Saiga antelope, just three hours old. His only company, his twin. Until they can stand, their mother has left them hidden in the grass. They should be safe, as long as they remain quiet. For these calves, the clock is already ticking. Their herd will soon be moving on, seeking the freshest new grass. Their lanky legs are a sure sign that they're built for a life on the move. Saiga always give birth to twins, so their numbers grow rapidly just when grass is plentiful. Their bizarrely shaped nose can detect fresh growth from hundreds of miles away. The young twins will now begin the nomadic life they share with most animals on the world's open plains. Grasslands occur where rain is too sporadic for forests to exist. The rain that a grassland needs to survive for a year might arrive all at once. Storms like these can release Not much fun if you're out in it. Eventually the earth can't soak up any more, and the grassland undergoes a radical change. Many plants would drown here, but grasses thrive. They grow so fast, their leaves quickly rise above the water and into the sunlight. Here in southern Africa, water transforms one of the most remarkable grasslands on Earth, the Okavango. Every year, 5,000 square miles of grassland are flooded. For one pride of lions, this poses a major problem. There may be plenty of prey around, but lions struggle to run it down in water. The pride has three-month-old cubs. They've never seen water before. If their mothers don't make a kill soon, the cubs might not survive the week. But fuelled by the flood, the eruption of grass attracts new possible prey. Buffalo arrive in herds 2,000 strong. Powerful, aggressive and united, they're the most dangerous animal a lion can face. The biggest bulls don't run. They're simply too huge to be scared of lions. At 900 kilos, he weighs more than all five lionesses combined. The pride do have numbers on their side, but one sweep of his horns could be deadly. One distracts the bull up front, while her sisters attack from behind. The cats must somehow topple the buffalo, but with swamp under foot, they can't get any traction. The bull is weakening, but the lions are tiring, too. It's now a battle of will as much as strength. To live, the bull must somehow shake off the lioness. The bull is wounded, but thanks to his two-inch-thick hide, he will recover. For the pride, these are hungry times. But, ultimately, once the water recedes, there will be new life, and new food to benefit all. In the right conditions, grasses have the extraordinary ability to grow from first shoots to flower in a matter of only days. Grasses become the miniature equivalents of fruiting trees. And for creatures living within the grass, this is a landscape as vast and towering as any rainforest. And excellent place to build a tiny tree house for a harvest mouse. During summer, European meadowlands are full of food, but only for those that can reach it. Climbing grass is harder than climbing trees, not least because their stems just won't stay still. Her prehensile tail acts like a fifth limb, so she's as agile as a monkey clambering around in a tree. And just as well, for the best food in this tiny forest is at the very top of its canopy. Feeding up here, she's exposed. A barn owl. Not her finest move... But it did the trick. Harvest mice seldom go all the way down to the ground. It's a tangled and dangerous world down here. But she can read the pattern of the stems overhead like a map, and so find her way home. And not a minute too soon. There are mouths to feed. Her babies must fatten up quickly. They need to harvest the summer grasses while they're still rich with food. On the African savannah, too, seasonal grasses are filled with life, but it won't last long. Carmine bee-eaters are superb aerial hunters, experts at catching insects in midair. But they have no way of flushing their prey out of the grass. Once alarmed, most insects stay put. The bee-eaters need someone to stir things up a bit. A kori bustard. It's the world's heaviest flying bird, so it should be bulky enough to kick up some insects. Bingo! Until someone else comes along and cramps your style. Never mind, perhaps there are bigger opportunities ahead. What about an ostrich? The heaviest bird of all. This time there's more than enough transport to go around. Soon, almost every ostrich has its own passenger. But free riders are only tolerated for so long. What the bee-eaters really need is a creature so big it won't even notice them. Nothing cuts a swathe through grass like an African bull elephant. The trick is to fly as close to the front of the giant as possible. They only have a split second to grab the prize. As more insects are stirred up, the competition intensifies. With summer drawing to a close, the race to stock up is on. Soon, the grass will wither, and this opportunity will have gone. As the dry season takes hold, food becomes increasingly thin on the ground. Now, only the most specialised predators on the plains can make a living. She may be spotted like a cheetah, but this cat is no sprinter. Instead, she has extra-long legs which give her a high vantage point. But a serval cat's main weapon are enormous radar ears. They help her pinpoint prey hiding in the grass. But the prey she seeks are canny. Southern vlei rats. They know that any sustained movement can give them away. So they move in short bursts. But even the slightest rustle will give her a clue. Warm. Warmer. Missed. In better times, she could catch 10 a day, but now, with so few rodents around, she will have to go hungry. As drought intensifies, life gets tougher for all. Predators with permanent territories must tough it out, while most of their prey disappear over the horizon. To avoid starvation, many grassland animals follow a nomadic way of life. Over 2,000,000 wildebeests wander the East African savannahs chasing the rains. And they are not alone. Arriving on the wing, Jackson's Widowbirds also seek fresh grass. Although, it's not just food that they're after. This male wants a mate. He's grown elaborate breeding plumage for this moment, but he needs a stage on which to show it off. By carefully selecting grass blades, each trimmed to the correct length, he's creating something very special. He needs an even surface, and a centre-piece. The stage is set. His bachelor pad is sufficiently neat and tidy to attract a female. The problem is, can she see it? He has competition. It might take more than a little gardening to impress the ladies. Jumping is the right idea, but he's misjudged the height of the grass. His rival makes it look easy. Time to raise his game. It's not only who jumps the highest, but who can keep doing so the longest. Unable to go the distance, his rivals drop out one by one. Stamina has won him admirers, now he can show off his courtship arena... And engage in a little romantic hide-and-seek. Finally, he's done enough. The East African savannahs support millions of grazers. Each year they devour millions of tons of grass, and yet there's one creature here whose impact is far greater than all these animals combined. They're found wherever grass grows on the planet, yet their labours go almost entirely unnoticed. One of the most remarkable is found here on the grasslands of South America. These blades are so tough that virtually no large grass eaters can stomach them. Yet they're harvested on an industrial scale by tiny grass cutter ants. But they themselves can't digest one bit of it. So, why bother? The answer is underground, and it's very ingenious. Each blade is cut to length and placed into a garden of fungus. The rotting grass feeds the fungus, and in turn the fungus feeds the ants. But feeding 5,000,000 workers requires intensive agriculture. Luckily, they are an industrious lot. This colony alone will collect over half a ton of grass every year. With billions of ant colonies across the world's grasslands all doing exactly the same thing, that's a mind-boggling amount of grass. It's estimated that over one third of the grass that grows on Earth will be harvested by an insect. In northern Australia, termites memorialise their industry in sculpture. These astonishing mounds are 10 feet tall. They're always built on a north-south axis, which is why their builders are called compass termites. These castles of clay protect their builders from extremes of heat and seasonal floods experienced on many grasslands. Termites manage to do what most grass eaters can't, break down dead grass and extract the nutrients. But they themselves can be food for those that can reach them. A two-foot-long tongue covered in microscopic hooks, followed by claws longer than those of a velociraptor. A giant anteater on the plains of South America. It can devour 20,000 insects a day. Powerful forelegs enable it to rip apart a termite hill with ease. And as the sun bakes the grass, the termites face new danger. In minutes, fire turns grassland to ash. But the grasses are not dead. Their underground stems are unharmed. Weeks, months may pass, but eventually the rains will return and the grass will sprout again. Some grasslands must endure not only fire, but ice. As winter approaches, the prairies of North America begin to freeze. In summer, bison roamed freely, almost continuously cropping the abundant green grass. Now, that grass is not only withered and frozen, it's about to be buried. Sixty million tons of snow now blanket this herd's territory. Pushing through deep snow is exhausting work, and the bison are now slowly starving. Just keeping warm saps huge amounts of energy. Their thick coats can insulate them down to minus 20 Fahrenheit. It's now minus 40. The only thing that will keep them alive is buried beneath three feet of snow. And that's a problem shared with a surprising neighbour. The food the fox seeks is also deep beneath the snow. The survival of both creatures depends on getting through to the ground. For the bison, it will be a matter of brute strength. Massive neck muscles enable them to shovel five tonnes of snow a day. Their light-weight neighbour needs more precision. The bison have reached their goal, a mouthful of withered grass. And where the bison have dug, the fox now spots an opportunity. Every footstep counts, but he mustn't break through... Yet. He listens carefully to pinpoint his target. It's moving. A vole. Small, but 100 times more nutritious than a mouthful of dried grass. To get through the winter on these prairies, sometimes brain beats brawn. Ultimately, life on all grasslands depends on the turn of the seasons. Five hundred miles further north than any tree can survive, grass returns to life. Caribou females have journeyed to the far north to calve. Over 70,000 caribou babies will be born in the next few days. As the calves appear, so too do the leaves of the newly sprouting grass. And the calves must strengthen quickly. Within days they will have to keep up with their parents on a never-ending march. At one day old, they're already faster than an Olympic sprinter. They're testing the legs that will carry them thousands of miles, better to learn their limitations now. It may look playful, but there's no harder life on the grasslands than that facing these infants. The caribou mothers now join together, each with an infant exactly the same age. They're setting off on the greatest overland trek made by any animal. But wherever grass eaters travel, predators lie in wait. Here they are, Arctic wolves. They must seize their chance while the caribou pass through their territory. The wolf runs at the herd, trying to flush out the weak or the slow. A calf is separated. At full tilt, 40 miles an hour, the wolf is just faster. But the calf has stamina. Only a few weeks old, and this calf's will to survive is remarkable. And it needs to be, for these young caribou have now started a journey that will last a lifetime. Forever chasing the seasonal growth of the grass on which they depend. Like all grassland creatures, they are at the mercy of these unpredictable but ultimately bountiful lands. Grass can survive some of the harshest conditions on Earth, flood, fire and frost, and still flourish. So it is that grasslands provide a stage for the greatest gatherings of wildlife on planet Earth. For the grasslands team, no location would prove as challenging as that dominated by elephant grass in northeast India. The aim, to capture intimate images of some the world's most elusive creatures using the latest technology. But they will need to be careful. More people are killed by wildlife here in Kaziranga than in any other national park on the planet. Every time we go into these tunnels, we have to take an armed guard, 'cause there are so many animals in here that are dangerous. Tigers are probably the least of our worries, but rhinos and buffalo, elephants, sloth bear, all of them can injure you. And we gotta keep up with our armed guard. The team have bumped into their first obstacle. There's a rhino right there. Let's go back because it's too risky going through this heavy grass. Let's get in the open. There's another rhino. - Now we have two rhinos. - Let's get in here. Okay. The guard throws a ball of mud to one side of the rhinos, moving the animals on without harming them. - We're okay. It's gone. - Okay. What about the other one? Let's go, quick. With the rhinos now a safe distance away, the crew focus on the best spots to position their camera traps. I love that tunnel, the effect. Over 100 scaffold poles provide the anchor points for these secret cameras. When an animal triggers an infrared beam, the cameras will switch on automatically and start recording. If it works, the remote-control cameras should capture close-up footage without disturbing the animals or putting the crew at risk. Basically, that's about as much like grass as we can make it look. As night falls, the crew head back to base for safety. It's time for the new technology to prove its worth. At dawn, the crew have a whodunnit mystery on their hands. Oh, wow. That's carnage! This looks like elephant, we think? This is scaffold pole they have bent. Look at that. It's a sad day. You win some, you lose some. And this time, the animals have outsmarted us. In fact, check this out. Whoo-hoo. So this is our little army of guards, protecting our trigger box. Do they bite? These ones, they bite? Sting? Whoa! Argh! Ow! The little (BLEEP). While Chadden irons out the bugs, Sandesh has met some grumpy locals. Wild Asian water buffalo have extraordinary senses. Mothers will charge if they feel threatened. The guard carries a gun, in case a warning shot is needed, and with good reason. More people are killed by buffalo than by any other animal in Kaziranga. That'll wake you up in the morning. Many of the park staff have cautionary tales about buffalo. The buffalo caught him here, through his throat and the horn came out through his mouth and flung him before running away. It's a miracle that he's still alive. If the wildlife is unfriendly to humans, it's proving downright hostile to camera traps. Completely ripped out the scaffold poles, they've torn the triggers. While Chadden is convinced it's elephants, the rest of the crew are not so sure. This is huge! It's almost like a human footprint. You can see the front paw, the rear paw. We are now two weeks in and it's very frustrating. I've never actually been anywhere where the animals go after your equipment and destroy it, more than here. It's time for the team to do some detective work. Here is our little security camera. If any animals are coming through and vandalising our main cameras, we hope that they're being caught on these little things. As the crew up their spying efforts, the guards take them to a promising lead. Nothing attracts tigers like a rhino carcass. It's very fresh. It's like from the morning. And it looks like there's a tiger cub, so it should be a tigress with cubs, coming to feed on this rhino carcass. It's pretty cool. Chadden decides to give the camera traps one last chance. If there are tigers around, they might scare away the mystery vandals. Elsewhere in the park, the security cameras are turning up some unexpected results. At nighttime, survived another... Ooh! It's a bear. Wow, that's a very rare sighting. I've never seen a bear in Kaziranga. In all my years, never. - Oh, his fingernails... - Look at his claws, right on the lens. So I thought this was elephant damage. I never thought we'd see a sloth bear doing that. That's amazing. A return to the rhino carcass and the plot thickens. Our transmitter's gone. That's what tigers think of camera traps. Do you think there's a bit over there? Pieces. The security cameras have caught a new culprit. Oh, my goodness, there they are. Ooh! There it's a tigress, see that. It's a tigress. It snarled at the camera trap, look at that. Sure don't like camera traps. Okay. With the technology struggling, Sandesh decides to put himself on the frontline. - It's on. - And now we're ready. Time to get the tiger. He'll have no protection apart from a thin wall of grass, and must hope he's as well-hidden as the local wildlife. Over the next five days, Sandesh plays the role of human camera trap. Eventually, the more hands-on approach pays off. Traditional filming methods and a little bit of patience, have helped reveal the hidden creatures of Kaziranga. But it's good to know there are still wild places where animals like to keep their secrets. I knew it was elephants. Next time, we venture to the newest habitat on Earth, our cities. To reveal the extraordinary ways that animals survive in this man-made world. This is the newest habitat on Earth. It's here that animals have to contend with the greatest change that is happening to the face of our planet. In this decade, the urban environment is predicted to grow by nearly 30%. It may appear hostile to animal life, but for the bold, this is a world of surprising opportunity. Jodhpur, India. (LANGUR CALLS) A gang of bachelor male langurs has come to challenge the resident alpha male. (GROWLS) (CALLS) This alpha rules over a valuable urban territory. (DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE) But maintaining dominance here is a constant struggle. The bachelors have united to try and overthrow him. (LANGURS GRUNTING) If they win, one of the challengers will take over the alpha's troop of females, and may kill his infants. There are 15 males in this bachelor group. The alpha must evict every single one of them from his territory. He has chased half the bachelors away, but a splinter group has looped back and is harassing his females. (LANGURS SNARLING) (HOOTS) Once again, he has to battle. (LANGURS BARKING) (BARKS) Finally, he manages to expel them all. He returns home victorious, but with a serious wound on his right leg. It's a hard life for him in the city. Keeping the intruders away is a daily challenge. But it's worth it. For these urban territories are probably the best langur territories in the world. They're filled with rich feeding grounds. (BIRDS CAWING) Here in the temple gardens, the langurs have, over centuries, developed a surprising relationship. One that guarantee's them a constantly replenished source of food. (BIRDS CALLING) The people here associate langurs with the Hindu God, Lord Hanuman, and revere them. They're given all the food they can eat. And this high-energy diet has led to a baby boom. Female langurs in this city give birth to twice as many young as their forest counterparts. This mother is so well fed that her rich milk can support something rarely seen in the wild. Twins. And all these babies can create troops that are far larger than those found in the forests nearby. With less time spent looking for food, there is more time for play. (LANGURS SQUEALING) The rewards of living in a city can be huge. The challenge is to find your niche. (SIRENS WAILING) New York City. (HORNS HONKING) This densely built-up landscape is as unnatural as anywhere on Earth. (BRAKES SCREECHING) (BIRDS CALLING) And yet, this wild peregrine falcon looks out onto an ideal habitat. Strange as it may seem, this vastly-altered landscape replicates the conditions in which peregrines evolved. The towering buildings have a multitude of ledges on which falcons can nest, and the high perches that they need to catch the wind. (FALCONS SCREECHING) New York City has the highest density of nesting peregrines anywhere on the planet. Winds striking the sides of the skyscrapers are deflected upwards and can help the birds gain height. And the great areas of concrete roasting in the sun create thermals, so that, with very little effort, the birds can soar over the city. And so many peregrines can live here, because down at street level, there is a lot of potential prey. (PIGEONS CHIRPING) Diving from height, the falcons can reach speeds of over 200 miles an hour. But their prey stay down low and close to the buildings. Too risky. The peregrine pulls out of his stoop. But the effort is not wasted. The falcons need to flush their prey into the open. And Manhattan is surrounded by water. Out here the odds change. And in the peregrine's favour. (CHURCH BELL TOLLING) With abundant prey here all year round, it has taken only 40 years for these falcons to establish themselves here. And now, among skyscrapers, they're more successful than their cousins living in the wilderness. Mumbai, in India, is home to over 20 million people. And there are predators here that, though rarely seen, are rightly feared. Carnivores, lured by the prospect of plentiful unsuspecting prey are on the prowl. (DOG BARKING) - (SNARLING) - A leopard. Every night, under the cover of darkness they come out to hunt. (MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS) These are big animals, and they're looking for large prey to satisfy their hunger. To catch more than a glimpse of them and reveal their hunting behaviour, you need night-vision cameras. - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - (HORNS HONKING IN THE DISTANCE) Leopards have attacked almost 200 people here in the last 25 years. But humans are not their usual prey. These leopards are on the hunt for something else. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (SNORTING) Pigs. These leopards prefer to hunt the domestic animals that people have brought to the city in considerable numbers. (SNORTING) The pigs keep their family close. (PIG SQUEALING) (PIGLET SQUEALING) The ceaseless noise of the city plays to their advantage. It conceals their approach. And the leopards are using this cover to hunt all over the city. (PIGS SQUEALING) This is a thriving population. In fact, the highest concentration of leopards in the world is right here. (CHURCH BELLS TOLLING) It's not only the abundance of food that attracts wild animals to cities. They're usually several degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside. And here in Rome, in December, one animal is taking full advantage of this extra heat. And it's leaving it's mark. In a single winter's day, ten tonnes of its droppings rain down on the city. (HORNS HONKING) (SQUEALING) Starlings. In the evening, they come back to the warmth of the city after feeding in the neighbouring countryside. They must return to their roosting trees. But the first to do so are at the highest risk of being caught by birds of prey. So, they wait for others to arrive. There's safety in numbers. As daylight fades, the sky fills with a staggering one million starlings. And then follows one of nature's great spectaculars. (WHOOSHING) How, or indeed why, they perform these marvellous aerobatics, we still do not fully understand. Eventually, en masse, they brave the descent and fill the branches of their favourite trees. On these cold winter nights, the city's extra warmth can mean the difference between life and death. (CHIRPING) A city, of course, can provide not only shelter and abundant food, but glamour. These varied objects have been carefully chosen by a bird for their brightness and their colour. (TWIG SNAPS) This great bowerbird has spent over a decade building this collection of mostly man-made objects. Out on a golf course in Townsville, Australia, he's putting the final touches to his enormous bower, that he hopes will impress a visiting female. He spends two hours each day rearranging his prized objects. "Perhaps that would look a little better over there." But it seems that something is missing. Instead of going into town to collect new objects, he's decided to raid his neighbour's bower. "A clothes peg! Excellent!" "And a shiny toy car." It's a risky game if you get caught. The owner is back. (SCREECHING) There is one bower where the risk is worth it. A particular object has caught his eye. He'll have to wait for the owner to leave. This is his chance. A real treasure. A scarlet heart. "Got it." The stage is now set for female visitors. His luck may be in. The seduction can now begin. (SCREECHES) He's showing off his best goods. "Perhaps a little plastic piping? "Or maybe a bit of coloured string?" But his guest doesn't seem to be paying much attention. "A fork? "Madame?" Nothing seems to be working. Something is just not quite right here. But he still has one trick up his sleeve. (SCREECHES) The scarlet heart. (SCREECHING) (CONTINUES SCREECHING) As a final thrill, he expands the pink crest on the back of his head. The sign of his adulthood. But he's made a mistake. This is not a female but a young male who hasn't yet developed that head crest. And he's making off with the scarlet heart. (HISSING AND SCREECHING) It's not easy finding sex in the city. Raising a family in the city is not easy either. It's spring time in Toronto, and this mother raccoon has exchanged her native treetops for rooftops. (DOG BARKING) Since giving birth two months ago, she's kept her offspring safe and warm inside a chimney. (CHITTERING) Now, her young have outgrown their nursery. This is her first major challenge as a mother. The time has come to move to a new home. She needs to get her youngster to ground level. But instead of an easy climb down a tree, she is faced with a vertical drop, with little to cling onto. (SQUEALING) Her baby's first glimpse of the urban world, from a terrifying 30 feet up. This is the last of her litter to be brought down. Its siblings are already - busy exploring the area. - (CHITTERING) And they have much to learn. (WHIMPERING) This one has fallen into a back alley and is trapped. (CHITTERING) Mother comes to the rescue and demonstrates what must be done. (BABY RACCOON WHIMPERING) (CHITTERING) (BABY RACCOON YELPS) That's the way. Raccoons are opportunists. And they're eager to explore. But they'll have to learn very quickly how to get along in this strange new environment so full of hazards. (DOG BARKING) (WATER SPLASHING) Mother comes to the rescue once more. Urban raccoons are now demonstrably better at problem-solving than their country cousins. When the feeding opportunities are this good, the time spent working out how to get to it is well worth it. The complexity of urban life favours the clever. (HORNS BLARING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING AND CHATTER) But to compete with humanity during daylight hours, takes more than just intelligence. It takes nerve. One enterprising species of monkey has moved into the city of Jaipur in India. The Rhesus macaque. But how to get a share of all this juicy fruit? Every morning, the troop make the same journey through the urban jungle, just as human commuters do. (HORNS HONKING) Sometimes, inevitably, there are traffic jams. Once they get to the market, trouble begins. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING AND CHATTER) Being both intelligent and brazen is the key to beating human beings on their home turf. (MAN SHOUTING REPELLENTLY) It's daylight robbery. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) There are some animals that most would consider too dangerous to tolerate in the city. Spotted hyenas. (HYENA WHOOPING) They're feared throughout their range. (SNARLS) (HYENAS BARKING AND WHOOPING) In the outskirts of Hara in Ethiopia, two clans are coming face to face to battle over a prized resource. (WHOOPING AND YELPING) There are about 60 hyenas in each clan. And they're well matched. After three hours of posturing back and forth, the losers retreat and the victors head to claim their prize. They have been fighting over access to the city. Once inside the city walls, they head for one place. (CHITTERING) And they know exactly how to get there. (WHINING) (GROWLS) The ancient meat market. The scent of all these carcasses lies heavy in the air. (SNARLING) This tradition goes back over 400 years. The human butchers put out the bones they don't need and these hyenas deal with them. They're the only animals that can. No other here has such powerful bone-crushing jaws. (YELPING AND BARKING) And this relationship between man and beast has now been taken a step further. (MAN HOOTING) Yousuf is calling the hyenas to his house. He and his forefathers, going back five generations, have been feeding the hyenas by hand. The inhabitants of this town believe that hyenas provide another very important service. Eating the bad spirits that haunt the streets. These are wild and ferocious animals, but once within these city walls, they behave in a completely different way. Throughout the rest of Africa, spotted hyenas are feared because they kill livestock, sometimes even children. (CONTINUES HOOTING) They are perhaps the most vilified animal on our planet. However, here in Harar, their relationship with people is entirely peaceful. (CONTINUES HOOTING) They have won the trust of man. Losing its fear of humans has enabled one animal to spread into cities everywhere, and in huge numbers. (PIGEONS CHIRPING) Pigeons are by far the most successful urban bird. (CHURCH BELL TOLLING) Here, in Albi, in the south of France, the pigeons come to the river to bathe. They need to preen their flight feathers, clean off the city dust, and cool themselves down. But death lies in wait. A predator that has taken advantage of the very thing that has led to the pigeon's success... Their lack of fear. As the pigeons bathe, oil from their plumage flows downstream, and is detected. A monstrous Wels catfish. Introduced here just 40 years ago, they have proliferated. Virtually exterminated the local fish stocks... And they've now developed a taste for pigeon. Their eyesight is poor, so they use their barbels to sense the movements of their victims. This is a radical new hunting strategy for what is normally a bottom-dwelling fish. After a thousand years of living in this city, pigeons are now having to learn to avoid a fish. (CHURCH BELL TOLLING) Our cities are always changing. Sometimes very swiftly. And animals must cope with the changes, or disappear. One of the greatest changes in recent times has come from a single invention made less than 140 years ago. Electric light. It has become more and more powerful, filling our streets with light. It's everywhere in the city. It even goes under ground. (HORNS BLARING) The difference between day and night is becoming less and less perceptible. And that has a profound effect on the activities of wildlife. In the wilderness, light triggers all kinds of behaviour. On the night of the full moon, hundreds of tiny hawksbill turtle hatchlings emerge from the safety of their nest deep in the sand. Their instinct is to reach the sea as quickly as possible. And their guide is the light of the full moon reflected on the water. But this young hatchling is confused. It's going in the wrong direction. Bright light is coming from the land. And all these hatchlings are travelling up the beach towards it. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) Predators are ready to take advantage. Crabs now make their burrows directly beneath the beach lights and wait for their prey to come to them. Even if a hatchling escapes, they're still in peril. (VEHICLES PASSING) The lights become more and more bewildering. 80% of all hatchlings on this beach are now disorientated by the lights of the town. Roads bring many to their end. Hundreds get trapped in storm drains every night. Exhausted by the effort of travelling such a distance on land, this hatchling's chances of surviving the night are slim. This turtle is one of the countless species that have been unable to adapt to the change brought about by the urban environment. Only a small number of animals have managed to find ways of living alongside us. And every 10 years, an area the size of Britain disappears under a jungle of concrete. But it doesn't have to be like this. Could it not be possible to build cities more in harmony with nature? How, and whether we decide to invite the wildlife back, is up to us. This tree is rising nearly 30 storeys. It's one of almost 800 being planted to create a vertical forest in Milan. This number of living trees would normally fill two hectares of woodland, but here, they occupy one-tenth of that area. Greening the walls and roofs of our buildings could create a rich and extensive habitat, if we wanted it to do so. There is one city where that idea is being applied on a major scale. Singapore. Two million trees have been planted here in the last 45 years. (BIRDS CHIRPING) This city is now richer in species than any other in the world. And this practise extends to all parts of the city. The waterways have been cleaned up, and smooth-coated otters are coming back. But perhaps, the most spectacular example of city greening is this grove of super trees. These 150 feet high metal structures are now full of life. Creepers have been planted to grow over the outermost branches. This is a new urban world that we have now designed and built with others in mind. Create the space, and the animals will come. Is this a vision of our cities of the future? It could be possible to see wildlife thriving within our cities across the planet. We, after all, are the architects of the urban world. Now, over half of us live in an urban environment. My home, too, is here in the city of London. Looking down on this great metropolis, the ingenuity with which we continue to reshape the surface of our planet is very striking, but it's also sobering. It reminds me of just how easy it is for us to lose our connection with the natural world. Yet it's on this connection that the future of both humanity and the natural world will depend. It's surely our responsibility to do everything within our power to create a planet that provides a home not just for us, but for all life on Earth. For a wildlife film crew, working in the urban environment was an altogether different experience. Two crews set off on two very different missions. It's Mark and Louis's first time in India. Passed this moped, and we're not stopping. We're going. Oh, my God! Yeah, we're in India. Along with the rest of the team, they hope to film up close and personal with the monkeys that have come from the wild to live in the hustle and bustle of the city. I can't believe these macaques have left the peace and quiet for this mayhem, but they're fine here. In fact, they're probably a bit more comfortable than I am with this noise. - (CAR HORN HONKING) - Yeah, yeah. And to get into the monkey's world, Mark will be using a new rig that stabilises the camera and allows him to get right into the action. I think Mark and Louis have got a big challenge. To be, uh, wielding thousands of pounds worth of camera equipment down at the street level. (LAUGHS) Rather them than me. - On your left. I'm more used to a jungle, if I'm honest. Erm, well, this is a jungle all of its own. Just with people instead of trees. (LAUGHING) This really... It's impossible. Seven hundred miles south, in Mumbai, cameraman Gordon Buchanan will have to take on a completely different filming approach if he is to capture an urban leopard hunt. (GOAT BLEATING) It's amazing to think that standing here, surrounded by people, all this, kind of, human activity, that within half a mile, maybe even less, there will be leopards. Only glimpses of these cats have been caught on camera, and just to locate them, he'll need new infrared camera traps. Are you happy with the composition? Good. What about you? Correct shutter speed? (LAUGHING) Gordon is hoping that these camera traps will reveal where they're on the prowl. For the monkey team, finding the animals seems easy... Rob, Rob, Rob. ...but keeping up with them is a different matter. - He almost stomped on that. - Ooh! They didn't put that on the hazard assessment. - A cow in the groin? - (LAUGHS) They're not frightened of us. They're, erm... I mean, look at this. (PIG SQUEALS) He's takin' on pigs, he's takin' on goats, he's takin' on cows. He's takin' on me anytime he wants to. But with monkeys this brazen, Mark is able to follow the troop at street level. (MACAQUES SCREECHING) To capture their movements in their rooftop world, they need to run a cable between buildings and fly a camera along it. And that calls for some inventive rigging. I've got this soft satsuma here, and I've got to lob it to the team on the other side, over there. We're gonna lob it from rooftop to rooftop. We've made sure there's no one on the rooftops and it's safe to do it. You ready? Okay. Okay, good. That's good. I got it into the courtyard. So that's perfect. I think our cable run at the moment is about 60 metres. And we can travel the whole length, while panning and tilting and really looking at everything we want to. It should give us some really dynamic stunning shots. The team is getting an insight at all levels into the monkeys' mischievous lives. (MONKEY SHRIEKING) And are starting to figure out the routes they use to cross the city. And over the course of weeks, the macaques become all too familiar with the crew. All right, little monkey. All right. They're now fully embedded in the troop, and Mark is able to film right amongst them. We've got monkeys behaving naturally. It's fantastic.  Back in Mumbai, the camera traps are revealing where the leopards are coming out. But to stand any chance of capturing them hunting in the city, Gordon will need to use the latest thermal camera technology. (DRUMMING AND TRUMPETING) (FIRE CRACKER EXPLODES) (WHISPERING) I can't imagine that a leopard's gonna come with all this going on. Relative silence eventually descends. Okay, I picked up some movement behind some bushes on the camera. Just a, sort of, a twinkling of light. It's something warm-blooded. Here we go. A leopard. You dancer, look at that. It definitely knows that I'm here. That's the type of sighting that you'd have to wait for weeks and weeks to get a leopard that close, and so airily open. Over the next month, this camera enables Gordon to see into the darkness, and be the first person to film an urban leopard hunt. But it's only at the end of the trip that he has his most memorable encounter. He's coming up. He's coming up. He's coming up. My goodness! Look at that. He's about three metres in front of me. Hey, there! (SMACKS LIPS) My heart is racing. That was close. That's the closest I've ever been to a leopard. It's often the case with urban wildlife is that it's the presence of human beings that allows certain animals to do well. And I suppose it's just incredible that one of those animals is the leopard. It isn't just Gordon getting an insight into the surprising wildlife encounters possible in the city. It's in Jodhpur, filming the langurs, that the monkey team really see the extraordinary relationship between humans and animals in Indian cities. They're so tolerant. They're amazing. And it makes a strong impression on them. Oh, it's beautiful! Yeah, that is beautiful. I mean, this phenomenal connection with incredible creatures, and that just feels wonderful. It was a surprising revelation that it was in cities where the film crews had some of their most extraordinary encounters with wild animals.
